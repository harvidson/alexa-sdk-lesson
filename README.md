##I Can Alexa and So Can You
Have you, ever spent an afternoon shouting at a computer and wishing it would just do the thing you said? Have you giggled to yourself after making a voice synthisizer repeat "doo doo" for minutes straight? Have you wished that there was an intersection of the two preceding things packaged in a handy JavaScript SDK?

Well, dear reader, I have good news about your increasingly specific wishes. Amazon has a Node SDK for their Alexa Skills Kit, and it reduces the learning curve for getting your hands dirty with Alexa Skills by A Lot. 

###Getting Started
Clone this repo and run 
```npm install```
from within the src folder. You'l also want to install a quick and dirty Alexa skill tester globally, so run
```npm install -g alexa-skill-test```
when you're done.
